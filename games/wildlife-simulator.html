	<h1>Wildlife Simulator</h1>
	
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>
		Wildlife Simulator is a multiplayer fighting game where you get assigned an animal and try to slay other beasts (or just run and annoy people if you are a rabbit). The game requires one computer connected to wifi running the game, and then as many HTML5 compatible devices (phones, tablets, other computers, anything with wifi and a browser) may connect to it and join the brawl! 
	</p>
	
	<h3>Controls</h3>
	<p>
		To move, drag and hold around the center of the screen. To use your animal's move just tap the screen. Your animal's objective is listed on your device. Have fun!

	<h3>Installing</h3>
	<p>
		To play this game, run the executable on a computer. Then with a smartphone, tablet, or computer, open a browser and go to <a class="link" href="http://happyfuntimes.net/">happyfuntimes.net</a> and join the game! Since there is a lot of networking magic going on to make this very easy to the user, things may go wrong so please refer to troubleshooting section if needed.
	</p>
	<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>make sure you are on the same wifi as the machine hosting the game</li>
		<li>forward port 18679 on your router</li>
		<li>try using the Chrome browser</li>
		<li>manually type in the host computers ip address to your web browser (super tedious, but very good chance of working) using this format: "http://[host_ip_address]:18679"</li>
		<li>BEST PLAYED ON 16:9 ASPECT RATIO</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Development</h3>
	<p>
		I made Wildlife Simulator over the course of a weekend at HackUCI 2017. I wanted to make a game using the <a class="link" href="http://docs.happyfuntimes.net/">HappyFuntimes library</a> which allows you to connect many HTML5 compatible devices to a computer over the same local wifi network. It opens up the possibility to easily make games with a very large number of players, because it bypasses the need for conventional controllers, and most everyone these days has a smart phone. In the top image you can see multiple players playing on their phones!
	</p>
	<p>
		Though HappyFunTimes came with some default controllers, I ended up making a custom one that felt simpler to control while looking at the game instead of your phone. Also, I wanted to add a scoring system but ran out of time in the jam. I might add this later though as it would validate bunnys since they would get points just by living, hah!
