<h1>Wildlife Simulator</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
	Wildlife Simulator is a multiplayer fighting game where you get assigned an animal and try to slay other
	beasts (or just run and annoy people if you are a rabbit). The game requires one computer connected to wifi
	running the game, and then as many HTML5 compatible devices (phones, tablets, other computers, anything with
	wifi and a browser) as you want may connect to it and join the brawl!
</p>

<h3>Controls</h3>
<p>
	To move, drag and hold around the center of the screen. To use your animal's move just tap the screen. Your
	animal's objective is listed on your device. Have fun!

</div>

<h3>Installing</h3>
<p>
	To play this game, run the executable on a computer. Then with a smartphone, tablet, or computer, open a
	browser and go to <a class="link" href="http://happyfuntimes.net/">happyfuntimes.net</a> and join the game!
	Since there is a lot of networking magic going on to make this simple to join, please refer to
	troubleshooting section if you run into problems.
</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<ul>
	<li>make sure you are on the same wifi as the machine hosting the game</li>
	<li>forward port 18679 on your router</li>
	<li>try using the Chrome browser</li>
	<li>manually type in the host computers ip address to your web browser (super tedious, but very good chance
		of working) using this format: "http://[host_ip_address]:18679"</li>
	<li>BEST PLAYED ON 16:9 ASPECT RATIO</li>
</ul>

<h3>Development</h3>
<p>
	I made Wildlife Simulator over the course of a weekend at HackUCI 2017. I wanted to make a game using the <a
		class="link" href="http://docs.happyfuntimes.net/">HappyFuntimes library</a> which allows you to connect
	many HTML5 compatible devices to a computer over the same local wifi network. It opens up the possibility to
	easily make games with a very large number of players, because it bypasses the need for conventional
	controllers, and most everyone these days has a smart phone. In the top image you can see multiple players
	playing on their phones!
</p>
<p>
	Though HappyFunTimes came with some default controllers, I ended up making a custom one that felt simpler to
	control while looking at the game instead of your phone. Also, I wanted to add a scoring system but ran out
	of time in the jam. I might add this later though as it would validate bunnys since they would get points
	just by living, hah!
