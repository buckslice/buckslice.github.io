	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>
Starting with your bare hands, eat you way through each level, collect the rest of your mighty utensils, and take down ever tastier foes!

I made this game over the course of 4 days for the Walking Dead Game Jam. My game placed top 20 and received an honorable mention! This is the first complete game I developed using the Unity Engine and I learned much about it and C# programming. I also learned much about actually finishing a game and learning how to cut features and reduce scope while still building a fun game. My friend and I collaborated on the art and sound effects, which were very fun to produce!
