	<h3>Development</h3>
	<p>
	Stacked was made over the course of 6 months for the Capstone Game course at UC Irvine, which was the
	final project for Computer Game Science majors! My team consisted of five members: three programmers,
	one artist and one sound person. Every member of the team participated in design discussions and play
	testing of the game, and each of the programmers helped with various gameplay elements, UI programming, 
	bug fixing. Here is a list of my personal contributions:

	<ul style="padding-top: .5rem">
		<li>boss battle scripting / design / effects / animations / sounds</li>
		<li>level design / textures</li>
		<li>title and character selection scenes</li>

	</ul>
