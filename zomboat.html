<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>
	The zombie apocalypse has arrived, Irvine is burning, but you find a local ship captain who can offer you
	ferry to Hawaii! You get on the boat, everyone looks okay... though you hear someone with a horrible
	cough...
</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
	Zomboat is a fun local co-op game I worked on for the 2017 Global Game Jam! The theme was "Waves" so the
	game takes place on a ship and the waves crashing across it are an ever present threat and problem you have
	to deal with while playing.
</p>
<p>
	My team consisted of four
	programmers, two artists, and a musician, and the design was a team effort. I was one of the programmers and headed
	the usage of the awesome <a class="link" href="http://docs.happyfuntimes.net/">happyfuntimes</a> library for
	Unity which enabled our game to be played with tons of players (anyone with a smartphone or other browser
	capable device). It has been tested with over 20 players, but it can theoretically go as high as your
	computer can handle!
</p>

<h3>Controls</h3>
<p>
	Press [SPACEBAR] on the computer running the game executable to advance through splash screens and start
	new games.

	On the phones you steer your character by pressing and holding around the reticle in the middle of the
	screen. Tapping on the screen will perform your characters special action.

<h3>Installing</h3>
<p>
	To play this game, run the executable on a computer. Then with a smartphone, tablet, or computer, open a
	browser and go to <a class="link" href="http://happyfuntimes.net/">happyfuntimes.net</a> and join the game!
	Since there is a lot of networking magic going on to make this simple to join, please refer to
	troubleshooting section if you run into problems.
</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<ul>
	<li>make sure you are on the same wifi as the machine hosting the game</li>
	<li>forward port 18679 on your router</li>
	<li>try using the Chrome browser</li>
	<li>manually type in the host computers ip address to your web browser (super tedious, but very good chance
		of working) using this format: "http://[host_ip_address]:18679"</li>
</ul>
