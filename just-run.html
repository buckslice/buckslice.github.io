<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
I worked on this game with a group of 4 others for a VGDC weekend gamejam at UCI (4/10/2015).
The theme of the jam was "Random", and our group's secondary theme was "Death is Inevitable",
so in our game you have to wander through random levels of a zombie/trap infested compound until you inevitably die.
Progress is tracked in the top left with a counter displaying levels beaten since last death and a max score.
</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
In this game, you cannot fight, the only option is to run... just run!
Watch out for lethal spikes and poison pools which slow you.
You can lockpick the gates, but be sure to do so quickly, you never know what may be lurking behind you.
Beat each level by finding and escaping through the door.

	<h3>Bonus Content</h3>
<p>
I wrote a script which would load a level from a .png file, turn it into a 3D mesh, and then populate it with our various game entities.
It ended up working quite well and allowed each member of the team to easily contribute to the pool of levels, and so we ended up having around 25 total!
Below you can see an example of a generated mesh on the left from its source image on the right.
